# Lesson Plan JavaScript2 Week 2

## Agenda

The purpose of this class is to introduce to the student:

- What synchronous vs. asynchronous processes are
- What callbacks are and how to write your own
- How the event loop works
- Show 3 commonly used array functions (filter, reduce, map)

## Core concepts

FIRST HALF (12.00 - 13.30)

1. What synchronous vs. asynchronous processes are

Notes:

- Synchronous refers to a linear execution process: one step at a time
- Asynchronous helps us do multiple things in parallel

_Show examples_

2. What callbacks are and how to write your own

Notes:

- Callbacks are a way to introduce asynchronocity

**Do exercise**

SECOND HALF (14.00 - 16.00)

3. How the event loop works

Notes:

- The event loop is part of the browser
- It determines when any given function is executed

_Show examples_

4. Show 3 commonly used array functions (filter, reduce, map)

Notes:

- Array functions are predefined functions that come from the Array object
- Each function serves to manipulate arrays in a specific way

**Do exercise**
